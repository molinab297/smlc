# smlc - A Simple Matrix Library written in C

A very small, quick, and basic matrix library written in C. This library is purely written for interest in linear algebra/C programming and is not intended to compete in performance with other well known C/C++ matrix libraries. 

## Includes common and well known matrix algorithms such as:
  - basic matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
  - rotating and transposing matrices (only NxN matrices at the moment)
  - calculating determinants of matrices
  - converting matrices to reduced row echelon form
  - solving systems of equations as matrices (using backward substitution)
  - determining linear independence/dependence 
  - calculating eigenvectors & eigenvalues 
  
## Supported Decomposition Algorithms at the moment:   
  - LU Decomposition (Guassian Elimination/Reduced row)
  - Cholesky Decomposition

## Future Decomposition Algorithms / Matrix operations: 
  ???
  
### Facts about the Cholesky Decomposition Algorithm  
When it is applicable, the Cholesky decomposition is roughly twice as efficient as the LU decomposition for solving systems of linear equations.

Below is an animation of the Cholesky decomposition in-place algorithm on a 5Ã—5 matrix. Access pattern are in white and writing pattern are in yellow.
