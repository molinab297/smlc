# smlc - A Simple Matrix Library written in C

The intention behind this project is to create a very small, quick, and basic matrix library; and for that reason it is written in C. This library is purely written for interest in linear algebra/C programming and is not intended to compete in performance with other well known C/C++ matrix libraries. 

This library will include common and well known matrix algorithms such as:
  - basic matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
  - rotating and transposing matrices
  - calculating determinants of matrices
  - converting matrices to reduced row echelon form (using LU Decomposition) 
  - solving systems of equations as matrices (using backward substitution)
  - determining linear independence/dependence 
  - calculating eigenvectors & eigenvalues
